Feb 11, 2021:  tweepydownloadfavoritesv1.py and twitterdownloadtweetsfinalv1.py are the same.  I duplicate tweepydownloadfavoritesv1.py to twitterdownloadtweetsfinalv1.py for consistent naming convention purposes.  I can't delete tweepydownloadfavoritesv1.py because there are weblinks connected to my Python file.

Finished programs, codes, and exercises.  These are neither exercises nor tutorials.
